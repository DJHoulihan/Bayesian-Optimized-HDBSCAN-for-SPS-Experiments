# MLinPhysicsFinalProject
The final project code, data, and documents for the Machine Learning in Physics course. The goal is to create an ML algorithm that can classify different particle groups from a PID plot created during nuclear experiments. If successful, it would be cool to try and make it also create a gate around the group of interest so that reaction can be gated upon for future analysis.

The entire algorithm is run through the function 'PIDClassifier', which is located in the .py file of the same name. PIDClassifier calls functions from the other .py files in the repository. 'PIDClassifierNotebook.ipynb' contains the tests of the algorithm and the results of it being run.
